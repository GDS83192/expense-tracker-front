  setAuthToken(localStorage.token);
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AuthState>
      <ExpenseState>
        <GoalState>

2. Implement functionality to allow users to connect to financial accounts for automatic expense logging vs. manual
3. Add interactive elements such as positive messages when a user aa
4. Integrations with other lifestyle apps -- Toggl (Timetracker), Udemy, etc -- work to integrate applications so users can align them with their own personal goals.
